# ReflorestAR

Android app developed by myself for the final project of my Computer Engineering undergraduate course. 

This app was made with the purpose of reforesting burned down areas in the 2017 fire that occured in Portugal with help of AR technology.

A quick example of a reforestation project in the app:
